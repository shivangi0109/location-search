# React + TypeScript + Vite Overview

This TypeScript-focused web application integrates a map interface similar to Google Maps. It displays a map on the right and a search panel on the left. Users can type a location name, such as "New York," and press Enter to search for matching locations via an external API. The search results list the city and country of each location, along with a "Go" button. Clicking "Go" centers the map on the selected location. Built with Vite and plain React, this project emphasizes TypeScript usage without Redux.
